## **Fieldwork**
A succesful first PhD field trip to The Gambia where I learnt how to use the QIAcube DNA extraction robot for high throughput extractions at the [Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia](https://www.mrc.gm). Then traveled to Farafenni to help kick off the Gambian part of the Genoscent study. I had the opportunity to work with our field team visiting rural villages to recruit twins and at our field site collecting some of the first Gambian samples.
