## **Current:**
## **PhD project 2019-Present**

My PhD is part of the MRC-funded [GenoScent project](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/genoscent) which aims to investigate the genetic basis of attractiveness to mosquitoes, both in the UK and in a natural host-vector-parasite system in The Gambia. My project will focus on the skin microbiome to understand the natural attractants and repellants humans produce that make them more or less attractive to mosquitoes.

## **Public Engagement 2018-Present**

I co-organise "Outbreak: an introduction to careers in public health", a public engagment workshop funded by [MRC LID](https://mrc-lid.lshtm.ac.uk). The workshop aims to inspire the next generation of public health professionals. It begins with a short news reel that sets the seen of a malaria outbreak in London, students work against the clock to fight the disease. There are five interactive stations which introduce students to careers in Epidemiology, Statistics, Modelling, Diagnostics and Vector Control. At a time when students are making important A-level and university decisions, the exercise is a memorable introduction to the diversity of science-based careers and skill-sets involved in controlling a disease outbreak.

## **Past projects**
## **Masters summer project 2019**

Insitution: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine 

Supervisor: [Dr Ernest Diez Benavente](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/diez-benavente.ernest)

The project: 

A Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factor Analysis in Working Age Russians 

I investigated associations between established risk factors of cardiovascular disease (BMI, smoking and alcohol) the gut microbiota and cardiovascular disease. The project gave me the opportunity to learn how to use QIIME2 for microbiome analysis and work on a large explanatory analysis as part of the Know your heart study. I used linear regression to associate risk factors and the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum and family levels. Regression was also used to investigate associations of the relative abundance of bacteria with heart pathology markers associated with cardiovascular disease (NT-pro BNP and Troponin). 


## **Undergraduate project 2017-18**

Insitution: University of Liverpool/ Liverpool school of tropical medicine

Supervisor: [Dr Seth Barribeau (UOL)](http://seth.barribeau.com/home/) and [Dr Lee Haines (LSTM)](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-lee-haines)

The project: 

RNAi of mucin in Bombus terrestris defense against Crithidia bombi

My honour project aimed to establish RNA interference for transcript knock down of genes involved in bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) defence against the trypanosome parasite (Crithidia bombi). The project gave me the opportunity to do lots of independent molecular laboratory work throughout my third year. I learnt how to make double stranded RNA and was successful in feeding it to the bees. 


## **Summer studentship project 2017**

Insitution: University of Liverpool

Supervisor: [Professor Alan McCarthy](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/integrative-biology/staff/alan-mccarthy/) and [Dr Claire Scantlebury](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/integrative-biology/staff/claire-scantlebury/)

The project: 

[Development of a diagnostic test for Equine Histoplasmosis](https://csd-inventory.liverpool.ac.uk/life-sciences/news/stories/title,976960,en.php)

I was awarded SFAM funding for an eight week placement in the University of Liverpool Microbiology Research Group between my second and third year of my undergraduate degree. During the project I developed my molecular biology skills, had my first taste of research and achieved the project aim, proving that equine histoplasmosis is present in West as well as East Africa.
