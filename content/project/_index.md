## **PhD project**

My PhD is part of the MRC-funded [GenoScent project](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres-projects-groups/genoscent) which aims to investigate the genetic basis of attractiveness to mosquitoes, both in the UK and in a natural host-vector-parasite system in The Gambia. My project will focus on the skin microbiome to understand the natural attractants and repellants humans produce that make them more or less attractive to mosquitoes.

## **Public Engagement**

I co-organise "Outbreak: an introduction to careers in public health", a public engagment workshop funded by [MRC LID](https://mrc-lid.lshtm.ac.uk). The workshop aims to inspire the next generation of public health professionals. It begins with a short news reel that sets the seen of a malaria outbreak in London, students work against the clock to fight the disease. There are five interactive stations which introduce students to careers in Epidemiology, Statistics, Modelling, Diagnostics and Vector Control. At a time when students are making important A-level and university decisions, the exercise is a memorable introduction to the diversity of science-based careers and skill-sets involved in controlling a disease outbreak.
